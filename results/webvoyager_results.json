    "accuracy_score": 60,

    "steps_percentage": 100.0,
    "explanation": "The accuracy score is awarded because the system successfully followed the instruction to retrieve Eliud Kipchoge's marathon pace and the minimum perigee distance of the Moon, both of which are crucial pieces of information for calculating the answer to the task. However, it did not complete the calculation step, hence it's not a full match with the expected single step of producing '17' as an answer. The similarity score is higher as the actions taken by the system are semantically aligned with the steps necessary to answer the question, even though it did not reach the final calculation step within the time constraint. All actions taken were correct in intent and partially correct towards achieving the final goal, which merits a higher score considering leniency for partial progress and correct initial steps taken towards the final calculation.",
